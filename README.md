Background fracture detection using machine learning involves the use of computer algorithms to automatically
detect and classify fractures in medical images, such as X-rays or CT scans. This is an important application 
of machine learning in healthcare, as accurate and efficient fracture detection is crucial for diagnosis and 
treatment of patients. Machine learning models are trained on large datasets of medical images that have been 
manually annotated by experts, to learn how to identify fractures based on various features of the image, such 
as shape, intensity, and texture. Once trained, these models can be used to automatically analyze new medical 
images and identify fractures, potentially improving accuracy and reducing the workload of medical professionals.
